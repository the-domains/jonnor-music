On-board is lead vocalist from Sieges Evens last two albums ("Art of Navigating by the Stars" and "Paramount"), Arno Menses and the lead guitarist, Markus Steffens.  As I am a huge fan of those two album, this release was filled with both excitement and a bit of anxiousness. Will they try to do the same and fail? Will it be something entirely different? Awesome different or crappy different?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="23"><p>I've heard through it a number of times the last week and a half, and I can say that it is very much in the same direction as Paramount. Meaning that the music is mostly on the soft side (yet with plenty of contrasting harder parts), progressive and technical but without wankery. While some are probably disappointed that its not harder or more aggressive ("you call that metal!?") and find the lead/backing vocal interaction a bit cheesy, it's exactly what I loved about Sieges Even.  Hard to tell if I will come back to this album again and again as I do with Paramount and Art of Navigating by the Stars, but right here and now <em>it's perfect</em>.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual2col-a5e5b413-7a95-4212-97f7-a7459a5ce2fc" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="24"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 m-a" data-reactid="26"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="27"><h1 data-reactid="28"><span class="" data-reactid="29"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2011/09/silent-stream-of-godless-elegy-navaz/" class="font-title " data-reactid="30">Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy – Návaz</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 31 --></div><div class="Group Group--meta p-1 max-w-960px m-a" data-reactid="32"><!-- react-empty: 33 --><div class="Attribution op-70 font-title " data-reactid="34"><h5 data-reactid="35"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="36"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com">Jonnor</a></span></h5></div></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 ms-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="37"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="38"><p>I have a strong preference for music in a language I can understand, if nothing else than for the opportunity to mumble along.

'My Universe - Infinite Spaces' was a notable instrumental album for me, one I actually enjoyed! It's not often that I feel that instrumental songs can convey a story.<br> As usual I've kept most to metal, but a notable non-metal release was 'Fejd - Storm' (modern folk-inspired music, actually made by metalheads).  I'm not sure I'll come back to this album much but I absolutely loved it for a while. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQL3pGEytIY\">Cute right?</a></p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"c670ec4c-b42e-498f-8af5-3a8575ee930d","item":"2109716b-9d65-4723-874f-cc31234ae74a","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Other nice discoveries that I've made this year:","_html":"<p>Other nice discoveries that I've made this year:</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"60a192ef-27d0-49a0-9670-6ce7e33ecc82","item":"2109716b-9d65-4723-874f-cc31234ae74a","type":"list","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<ul><li>Animals as Leaders - Animals as Leaders</li><li>Blind Ego - Numb</li><li>Black Sun Aeon - Darkness walks beside me</li><li>Hourglass - Oblivious To The Obvious</li><li>Agnosia - Trace Decay</li></ul>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"da26e9a2-83aa-4919-97ab-1600cb871863","item":"2109716b-9d65-4723-874f-cc31234ae74a","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"A lot of the albums I anticipated also turned out great:","_html":"<p>A lot of the albums I anticipated also turned out great:</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"dbaf8999-9651-40b9-a8cc-ddbce977c830","item":"2109716b-9d65-4723-874f-cc31234ae74a","type":"list","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<ul><li>Indukti - Idmen</li><li>Isis - Wavering Radiant</li><li>Mew - No More Stories Are Told Today, I'm Sorry, They Washed Away</li><li>OSI - Blood</li><li>Porcupine Tree - The Incident</li><li>Riverside - Anno Domini High Definition</li><li>Shadow Gallery - Digital Ghosts</li></ul>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"736486fb-a2d0-4a56-adfc-a5f7c4d5a599","item":"2109716b-9d65-4723-874f-cc31234ae74a","type":"h3","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Downs","_html":"<h3>Downs</h3>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"4023eba2-cc16-4012-9864-d946ad13baa8","item":"2109716b-9d65-4723-874f-cc31234ae74a","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"As a 'concert year' 2009 was pretty terrible for me.
