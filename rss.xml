            <title><![CDATA[Jon Nordby]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>I originally planned on doing a post on some of my favorite albums of 2009.  But I was having some trouble picking out only a few, and I don't really want to limit myself to my favorites. So I'm doing a series of posts, showing some favorites, some disappointments and the occasional oddity (musical or otherwise). Consider it a kind a of Christmas/advent calendar, if you want.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tragedy</h1><p>It's a tragedy, that some hide behind a mask. Pretending that everything is good, pretending to be someone else. It's a tragedy, that the mask is never dropped. Not for friends, not for family.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>I have a strong preference for music in a language I can understand, if nothing else than for the opportunity to mumble along. But "Návaz", the latest album from Czech band Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy, is a little gem, even if I can't understand a word of the Czech lyrics. Návaz, like the previous albums is a doom metal album with strong influences from Moravian folk music and lore. What I like most about this album are the heavy contrasts: Quick, playful violins against slow, drudging guitar riffs; soft female voice against harsh male voices; traditional folk instruments and musical themes against modern metal.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>This album is one of, if not the absolute favorite of mine this year. Which is surprising since it has nearly no vocals at all. Typically good vocals is almost a requisite for me liking an album. But these guys from Sharon, Massachusetts, USA pulled it off. An near-instrumental album that I not only liked but blew my mind.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>A few weeks back I saw Gojira (warning: horrible flash based site, even the myspace page is better) at Knaack here in Berlin. While I hadn't listened to Gojira much before going, it was a great show. Nice venue, sound was good, kick-ass music and performance, and the crowd loved it. What more can you ask for? The event was promoted by a company called Trinity Concerts, and apparently they do a whole bunch of good stuff this autumn. Here are the ones I plan to go to between now and Christmas:</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>Whaaat, something not metal?  And no, I'm not gonna slaughter it. Cause I actually like it, and have in fact listened to it quite a bit. Yes, its cheesy as hell, and is nothing special far as musicianship go. But quite frankly, its catchy as hell and straight out rockin'. Can't resist it!</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>Subsignal emerged from the ashes after the german progressive metal band Sieges Even split up about a year ago.  On-board is lead vocalist from Sieges Evens last two albums ("Art of Navigating by the Stars" and "Paramount"), Arno Menses and the lead guitarist, Markus Steffens.  As I am a huge fan of those two album, this release was filled with both excitement and a bit of anxiousness. Will they try to do the same and fail? Will it be something entirely different? Awesome different or crappy different?</p></article>]]></description>
