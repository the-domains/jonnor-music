# Lost in Thought -- Opus Arise

If you're a fan of traditional progressive metal, you might want to check out [Lost in Thought][0] s debut album: Opus Arise.

Released April 29th this year, Opus Arise features some very solid songwriting much in the style of Dream Theater and similar bands. The musicianship is generally excellent, and the production is stellar. On the downside, this is not a very original album by any measure, you will not find too many fresh ideas or expressions in this album. So if you're looking for something that takes progressive metal in a new direction; look elsewhere.

Here is the opening track, Beyond the Flames.

My favorite tracks include the slower [Blood Red Diamond][1] and the kicking closing track Assimulate, Destroy. You can find the album [on Amazon][2].

Sadly the band [had a car accident][3] on their first European tour in late May, which left the drummer with a broken leg and having to undergo surgery. [A news post comment][4] from the drummer, and [a recent interview][5] seems to indicate that the recovery so far is going OK. Hopefully he will be fully recovered, back to playing drums, soon.

A friend told me that I should blog about music again. This was a shot at doing just that.
