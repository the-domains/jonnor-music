# Jon Nordby

This album is one of, if not the absolute favorite of mine this year. Which is surprising since it has nearly no vocals at all. Typically good vocals is almost a requisite for me liking an album. But these guys from Sharon, Massachusetts, USA pulled it off. An near-instrumental album that I not only liked but blew my mind.

I'm not sure if I can explain just why that is though. Perhaps it is the kind of chaos that characterizes the more hard and dominant parts of the musics at times. Contrasted with the very smooth and pretty yet complex softer parts, . Combined with the fleeting song-structures so that the song not as much transitions as it evolves.  
Perhaps that was the gist of it. Those elements were definitively involved.

When I had heard it through I _had_ to look for similar music. The only thing that really sticked there was North - Ruins (2007), which really is a lesson in melody through disharmony.  
Both albums are highly recommended to anyone looking for something new. Do note that this probably is not the easiest music to like, so be prepared to give it some effort.
