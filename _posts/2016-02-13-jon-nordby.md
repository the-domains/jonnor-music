# Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy -- Návaz

I have a strong preference for music in a language I can understand, if nothing else than for the opportunity to mumble along. But "Návaz", the latest album from Czech band [Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy][0], is a little gem, even if I can't understand a word of the Czech lyrics.  
Návaz, like the previous albums is a doom metal album with strong influences from [Moravian][1] folk music and lore. What I like most about this album are the heavy contrasts: Quick, playful violins against slow, drudging guitar riffs; soft female voice against harsh male voices; traditional folk instruments and musical themes against modern metal.

Here is the opening track, Mokoš, which I think is quite representative:

Those who don't have the stomach for the above, thinking it is too noisy, might still enjoy the songs [Sudice][2] or [Samodiva][3]. More samples are available on their [Myspace page][4]. You can find the album [at Amazon][5].

If you liked this music you should also consider checking out In Via (2010) by [Illuminandi][6]. Style wise it leans closer to gothic metal, more gloomy and bleak, but overall very much the same type of feel.
