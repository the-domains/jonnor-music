# Musical Highlights of 2009

I originally planned on doing a post on some of my favorite albums of 2009\. But I was having some trouble picking out only a few, and I don't really want to limit myself to my favorites. So I'm doing a series of posts, showing some favorites, some disappointments and the occasional oddity (musical or otherwise). Consider it a kind a of Christmas/advent calendar, if you want.
