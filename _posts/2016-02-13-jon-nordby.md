### Free Spirit -- Pale Sister of Light

Whaaat, something not metal? And no, I'm not gonna slaughter it. Cause I actually like it, and have in fact listened to it quite a bit. Yes, its cheesy as hell, and is nothing special far as musicianship go. But quite frankly, its catchy as hell and straight out rockin'. Can't resist it!

The production on this debut album is flawless and the quality of the songs are pretty even over the entire album. While I get tired of this kind of music after a while, I'm sure those who hold this kind of music close to the heart will love this album through and through into eternity.  
If you think you might be that type you should check out Dokken - Lightning Strikes First (2008) while you're at it.
