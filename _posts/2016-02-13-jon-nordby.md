# Jon Nordby

It's a tragedy, that some hide behind a mask.  
Pretending that everything is good,  
pretending to be someone else.  
It's a tragedy, that the mask is never dropped.  
Not for friends,  
not for family.

It's a tragedy, that some find life so hard  
That a quick end seems the best solution.  
It's a tragedy, and it happens every day.

To H.
